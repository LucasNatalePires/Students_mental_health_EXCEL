# Students_mental_health_EXCEL
After an internal survey of students, the educational institution is concerned about the relationship between smartphones and excessive exposure, and how this affects academic performance and mental health.

This project, based on some features, aims to determine, based on study patterns/method/duration/excessive exposure on the smartphone:

- Academic performance

- Mental Health

- Observe points of attention, to avoid further damage, or even improve performance

- Prevent future damage

- Check whether the educational institution, after this diagnosis, can provide any type of assistance.
